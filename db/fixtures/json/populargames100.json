Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been &quot;discovered&quot; by invaders from a far-off land.

In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Brass: Birmingham</strong></em> is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass</em>. <em>Birmingham</em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.</p>\r\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Build</strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br />2) <strong>Network</strong> - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network.<br />3) <strong>Develop</strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br />4) <strong>Sell</strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br />5) <strong>Loan</strong> - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> also features a new sixth action:</p>\r\n<p>6) <strong>Scout</strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.</p>\r\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass</em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game.

      "description_preview": "   Brass: Birmingham   is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece,  Brass .  Birmingham  tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. \r\n As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. \r\n Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): \r\n 1)  Build  - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)  Network  - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)  Develop  - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)  Sell  - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)  Loan  - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  also features a new sixth action: \r\n 6)  Scout  - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New \"Sell\" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. ",

You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!</p>",

      "description": "Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor's word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the &quot;Hitler&quot; identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players' trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.",

Position your Targi figures on the cards that border the desert. You carry out the actions of those cards as well as the cards at the crossroads between them. If you don?t go to the merchant, you won?t be able to trade ? and even worse, your opponent will. Or maybe a caravan will bring the merchandise you desire. There are many choices to consider. But don?t wait too long, the desert is harsh and you might miss an opportunity to make a deal. In the next round, a completely different set of offerings will be on the table. The goods cards are the means to the end of getting highly desired tribe cards. These in turn bring advantages during the game and victory points at the end. You can win only if you plan shrewdly and always keep some gold in your pocket.",

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resources necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant has a uniquely cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of resources to use, resulting in an output of more resources, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, VP and all kinds of resources. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for resources, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Convocation follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is almost all simultaneous play, keeping the game play moving.",

      "description": "Gear up for a thrilling adventure to recover a legendary flying machine buried deep in the ruins of an ancient desert city. You'll need to coordinate with your teammates and use every available resource if you hope to survive the scorching heat and relentless sandstorm. Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the Forbidden Desert! When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure!",

      "description": "<div><strong>Kingdom Death: Monster</strong> is a fully cooperative, tabletop, hobby game experience. Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Every decision matters. A space moved during the showdown, every resource spent to craft a piece of gear, what principles your settlement upholds - all can have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game. </div>\r\n<h3>Campaign System</h3>\r\n<div>Embark alone or with up to 4 friends (6 with game variant) on a 30 lantern year campaign. Each lantern year will cycle through a chaotic hunt, a showdown with a monster, and the development of your settlement. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign runs will be alike.</div>\r\n<h3>Monster AI System</h3>\r\n<div>You will fight 8 monsters, each controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty. (Except for the final encounter, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.</div>\r\n<h3>Gear System</h3>\r\n<div>In Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time.

      "description_preview": "  Kingdom Death: Monster  is a fully cooperative, tabletop, hobby game experience. Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign. \r\n   \r\n Every decision matters. A space moved during the showdown, every resource spent to craft a piece of gear, what principles your settlement upholds - all can have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game.  \r\n Campaign System \r\n Embark alone or with up to 4 friends (6 with game variant) on a 30 lantern year campaign. Each lantern year will cycle through a chaotic hunt, a showdown with a monster, and the development of your settlement. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign runs will be alike. \r\n Monster AI System \r\n You will fight 8 monsters, each controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty. (Except for the final encounter, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail. \r\n Gear System \r\n In Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time. What gear you will carry and how you arrange it can unlock advantages that may make the difference between life and death. \r\n Story Event System \r\n You will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your settlement's decisions and discoveries affect how the story events unfold. Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to dramatic turning points in your settlements history.  \r\n Kingdom Death: Monster Contents \r\n 19 lbs of Nightmare Horror Gaming \r\n 235 page hardcover rulebook, 18 hard plastic sprues of miniatures, 1000+ matte game cards, 400+ unique pieces of art, and 86 full page illustrations. \r\n   \r\n 1 x Hardcover Rule Book - 11\" x 8.5\" 235 Pages. \r\n 1 x Showdown Board - 2' x 3' ( Heavy 3mm Game Board Matte ) \r\n 1 x Hunt / Settlement Board ( Heavy 3mm Game Board Matte ) \r\n 2 x Token Sheet - 127 Tokens \r\n 1 x Terrain Token Sheet - 31 Terrain Tiles \r\n 1 x Monster Controller Panel \r\n 4 x Gear Grids \r\n 1 x Character Record Sheet Pad ( 50 Sheets, 6\"x6\") \r\n 1 x Settlement Record Sheet Pad ( 50 Sheets, 8.5\" x 11\") \r\n 5 x 10 sided black Kingdom Death dice \r\n 1 x 10 sided white Kingdom Death dice \r\n 4 x 6 sided Hit location dice \r\n 1 x 10 sided translucent orange Kingdom Death Death Die \r\n   \r\n Kingdom Death: Monster Contents - Miniatures \r\n 4 x Starting Survivors \r\n 1 x White Lion \r\n 1 x Butcher \r\n 1 x Screaming Antelope \r\n 1 x Kings Man \r\n 1 x The Hand \r\n 1 x Phoenix \r\n 1 x Watcher \r\n 1 x Gold Smoke Knight \r\n 1 x Unarmored Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Rawhide Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Leather Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x White Lion Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Screaming Fur Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Phoenix Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Lantern Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 4 x Bonus Mystery Miniatures \r\n 4 x Starting Survivor Heads for Armor Kit customization \r\n 9 x Assorted Survivor Heads for Armor Kit customization \r\n 150+ Gear for Armor Kit customization (Every weapon in the game represented!) \r\n 10+ Masks \r\n 10 x Decorative Stone Face Base Inserts \r\n 36 x Kingdom Death 30mm Base + Insert \r\n 6 x Kingdom Death 50mm Base + Insert \r\n 1 x Kingdom Death 100mm Base + Insert  ",
